# 📉 Customer Churn Risk Advisor

An interactive decision-support application built with **Streamlit** and **XGBoost** to predict customer churn probability, assign risk bands, and provide prescriptive retention strategies for telco operators.

## 📋 Model Card: Churn Risk Advisor v1.0

* **Intended use:** Rank existing telecom customers by churn risk so a retention team can prioritize calls. Decision support, not automation.
* **Not for:** Credit, pricing, or any decision that denies a service.
* **Data:** IBM Telco Customer Churn, 7,043 customers, 26.5% churn.
* **Model:** XGBClassifier, chosen by 5-fold CV. Features: 30 encoded columns.
* **Performance:** CV AUC 0.845 +/- 0.012; test AUC 0.842 (test set used once).
* **Threshold:** 0.35, from a cost analysis (FN = PKR 6,000, FP = PKR 1,000).
* **Limitations:** One US dataset from one period; no Pakistan data; associations, not causes; performance may drift as plans change.
* **Fairness check (Week 15):** Compare recall across gender and seniors.
* **Owner and version:** Rafi Haider, v1.0, October 9, 2026.

## 📌 Project Overview & Features

The **Churn Risk Advisor** bridges the gap between raw machine learning output and real-world business intervention[cite: 1]. Key capabilities include:

- **Real-time Individual Scoring:** Input specific customer attributes via a sidebar form to instantaneously generate a churn probability score, assigned risk band (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH), and recommended outreach action.

- **Prescriptive Counterfactual Analysis:** Dynamic *"What would change the risk?"* feature computes probability deltas for potential contract and service upgrades.

- **Batch Scoring & Export:** Drag and drop CSV customer data to process batch predictions, highlight high-risk accounts above a customizable threshold, and export scored reports.
